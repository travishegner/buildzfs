This simple set of scripts utilizes podman in rootless mode to build the zfs-utils, zfs-linux, and zfs-linux-headers packages using the PKGBUILDs found in the AUR. Just run `./build.sh` and all three packages will be dropped into the current directory. If you have more than 4 cores, you can prefix the command with `NUM_CPUS=16 ./build.sh` to get faster builds. You can also specify `ZFS_RELEASE` and `ZFS_GPG_KEY` if the default values don't work for your use case. This is most useful when the system at `ci.archzfs.com` is failing to deploy new releases. This build process may not work when the versions of linux and zfs are incompatible.
